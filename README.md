**üåï** Scripting in Lua, it's simple and has plenty of online resources.  
**‚ö°** Make hard tasks easy, straight from the Files app.

## Installation & Configuration

### Required:
  * Nextcloud >=23
  * PHP >=7.4

### Recommended:
The app includes a Lua interpreter which runs on PHP. This interpreter is still [under development](https://github.com/Raudius/Luar) and its use is **not** recommended. For a faster and more reliable solution, install the Lua PHP extension.

* Lua + PHP Lua plugin
```shell
sudo apt-get install lua5.3
sudo apt-get install liblua5.3-0
sudo apt-get install liblua5.3-dev
```

<details>
<summary>Lua plugin for PHP 7</summary>

```shell
sudo apt-get install php-pear
sudo apt-get install php7-dev

sudo cp /usr/include/lua5.3/lua.h /usr/include
sudo ln -s /usr/include/lua5.3/ /usr/include/lua
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.3.a /usr/lib/liblua.a
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.3.so /usr/lib/liblua.so

sudo pecl install lua-2.0.7
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Lua plugin for PHP 8</summary>
Since the Lua plugin is not yet officially supported for PHP8, we need to build it.

```shell
sudo apt-get install php-pear
sudo apt-get install php-dev

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/badoo/php-lua.git
cd php-lua
phpize && ./configure --with-lua-version=5.3
make

# The destination path may change depending on your PHP version
# You can find your extension directory by using:
# php -i | grep extension_dir
sudo cp ./.libs/lua.so /usr/lib/php/20200930/
```

</details>


Don't forget to append `extension=lua.so` to your `php.ini`!

### Optional:

<details>
<summary>Some functions require additional packages to be installed on the server.</summary>

* QPDF >=9.1.1 (needed for [PDF functions](docs/Functions.md#Pdf))
```shell
sudo apt-get install qpdf
```

* FFmpeg (needed for [FFmpeg](docs/Functions.md#ffmpeg) and [FFprobe](docs/Functions.md#ffprobe))
```shell
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

</details>

### Nextcloud Docker Container Setup

If you're using the Nextcloud manual docker image the below will get your environment setup. 
Note that you'll have to either rebuild the image with a dockerfile that includes these or run this script each time the container is rebuilt

<details>
<summary>Build and enable LUA</summary>
Similar to installing Lua for PHP8. Installs the packages needed, copies the lua.so file, 
and then writes out the ini needed which enables the extension for PHP. 
You will need to verify the destination path as noted in the commented lines in the event PHP is updated in the container and update yourcp and echo lines

```shell
apt update
apt install -y lua5.3 liblua5.3-0 liblua5.3-dev ffmpeg git

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/badoo/php-lua.git
cd php-lua
phpize && ./configure --with-lua-version=5.3
make

# The destination path may change depending on your PHP version
# You can find your extension directory by using:
# php -i | grep extension_dir
cp ./.libs/lua.so /usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20220829

echo extension=lua.so > /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-lua.ini
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Install release</summary>

Depending on your volume mounts is where you'll place the compressed archive
For example, if you have the following mounts in your docker-compose 
```shell
    volumes:
      - /mnt/containers/nextcloud/html:/var/www/html
      - /mnt/containers/nextcloud/apps:/var/www/html/custom_apps
```
You would extract the files_scripts archive into /mnt/containers/nextcloud/apps on your host machine

## Documentation

The [admin documentation](docs/Admin.md) contains information about how to create new actions and some precautions that should be taken when writing one.

The [scripting API documentation](https://github.com/Raudius/files_scripts/blob/master/docs/Functions.md) contains descriptions for all the API functions as well as some snippets of how they can be used.
